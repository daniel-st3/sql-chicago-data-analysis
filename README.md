A comprehensive SQL analysis project examining socioeconomic indicators, public schools, and crime data for Chicago communities.

---

## 📋 Overview

This project analyzes three interconnected datasets from the City of Chicago to answer critical questions about community health, safety, and education. Using SQLite and Python, the project demonstrates SQL querying capabilities including joins, subqueries, aggregation, and filtering.

### Datasets

1. **Chicago Census Data** (2008-2012)
   - Socioeconomic indicators including income, poverty rates, and hardship index
   - 77 community areas

2. **Chicago Public Schools**
   - School-level performance data for 2011-2012
   - Safety scores and school types

3. **Chicago Crime Data** (2001-Present)
   - Reported crime incidents across Chicago
   - Location, type, and case information

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Git
- ~2 MB disk space for database

### Installation & Setup (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using the automated setup script:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chicago-data-analysis.git
cd chicago-data-analysis

# Run the setup script
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# Run the analysis
python chicago_data_analysis.py
```

### Manual Installation

If you prefer manual setup:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chicago-data-analysis.git
cd chicago-data-analysis
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the analysis:
```bash
python chicago_data_analysis.py
```

### Expected Output

The script will:
1. Download the Chicago datasets (~2 MB total)
2. Create a SQLite database (`FinalDB.db`)
3. Execute 10 SQL analysis queries
4. Display results in a formatted table

First run takes 2-3 minutes due to data download. Subsequent runs are faster using cached database.

## 📊 Problems Solved

### Problem 1: Total Crime Count
**Question:** Find the total number of crimes recorded in the CRIME table.

This query provides a basic count of all crime incidents in the database.

### Problem 2: Low-Income Communities
**Question:** List community area names and numbers with per capita income less than $11,000.

Identifies economically disadvantaged communities for targeted support programs.

### Problem 3: Crimes Involving Minors
**Question:** List all case numbers for crimes involving minors.

Filters crimes where minors are mentioned in the description, highlighting juvenile involvement.

### Problem 4: Kidnapping of Children
**Question:** List all kidnapping crimes involving a child.

Combines two filters to identify the most serious crimes against children.

### Problem 5: School-Related Crimes
**Question:** List the kind of crimes that were recorded at schools (no repetitions).

Uses DISTINCT clause to identify unique crime types at educational institutions.

### Problem 6: School Safety Analysis
**Question:** List the type of schools along with the average safety score for each type.

Demonstrates GROUP BY aggregation and provides comparative safety metrics.

### Problem 7: Poverty-Stricken Communities
**Question:** List 5 community areas with the highest percentage of households below poverty line.

Identifies the most economically challenged communities using ORDER BY and LIMIT.

### Problem 8: Crime Hotspot
**Question:** Which community area is most crime prone?

Uses GROUP BY and aggregation to identify the area with the highest crime volume.

### Problem 9: Hardship Index Leader (Subquery)
**Question:** Use a sub-query to find the name of the community area with the highest hardship index.

Demonstrates subquery usage to find maximum values.

### Problem 10: Most Crimes by Community (Subquery)
**Question:** Use a sub-query to determine the Community Area Name with the most number of crimes.

Advanced subquery combining crime count with census data lookup.

## 🔧 Code Structure

### ChicagoDataAnalysis Class

The main class handles:
- Database connection management
- Data loading from remote CSV files
- Table creation
- Query execution
- Results formatting and display

#### Key Methods

- `connect_db()`: Establishes SQLite connection
- `load_data_from_urls()`: Downloads and ingests CSV data
- `store_data_to_db()`: Creates database tables from DataFrames
- `execute_query()`: Runs SQL queries and returns results as DataFrames
- `display_results()`: Formats and prints query results
- `run_analysis()`: Executes all 10 analysis problems

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'"
**Solution**: Install pandas using `pip install pandas`

### Issue: "No data loaded" or empty tables
**Solution**: Check internet connection. The script downloads data from remote URLs.

### Issue: Database lock error
**Solution**: Ensure no other process is accessing `FinalDB.db`. Delete the file and rerun.

## 📝 Notes

- The script automatically creates and overwrites the SQLite database on each run
- Large crime dataset may take a few minutes to download on first run
- Results are cached in the database after initial creation
- All queries are read-only and don't modify data
